We also consider the natural filtration $\\{\\mathcal {F_t}\\}_{t \\in I}$ generated by the Brownian Motion. As a consequence of the definition $W$, $S$, $M$ and, $m$ are $\\mathcal {F_t}$-measurable.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the applications we intend to develop here, the *Neutral Risk Valuation* principles will serve as our main tools used to aproach the *pricing problem* of *European Fractional Lookback Options*. As we will see more in detail, these principles will involve calculating expectations of the form:\n",

    "**The easiest case: $\\alpha \\leq 1$ and $\\beta \\geq 1$:**\n",
    "\n",
    "For these values of $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$, the payoff of both call and put options is almost surely positive (> 0). In this case, we are completely free to ignore the $^+$ in their expressions. This makes the problem much easier, once we now can decompose their payoff in the following way:\n",

    "Thus, the results we present there can be easily adapted to these calculations. Therefore, the pricing of *European Fractional Lookback Options* for $\\alpha \\leq 1$ and $\\beta \\geq 1$ is a problem we are already capable of solving in the context of the Black-Scholes and CEV models.\n",

In this context, we have no other option but dealing with the joint distribution of the pairs $(S_t, M_t)$ and $(S_t, m_t)$. Of course this approach is valid for all possible values of $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$, and that is the approach we will follow in this project.\n",
